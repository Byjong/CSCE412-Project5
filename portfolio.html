            Created a emulation of an Intel X86 CPU based of computer architecture Y86.<br>
            We used logisim evolution to design memory & control flow units to work together with I/O
            systems to create the CPU units that took in <a
                href="http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~reeves.92/CSE2421sp13/PracticeProblemsY86.pdf" target="_blank">
                Y86 operations</a> to store values in memory and perform basic
            ALU operations.<br>
            The entire project was partitioned into each of the main stages that are executed when a CPU is in use.
            These stages include, in order, Fetch, Decode, Execute, Write Back, Memory, PC Update. <br>
            We had to write assembly code instruction in a file and then upload the instructions to our digital ROM
            in order to convert the code into instructions that we could read into registers.<br>
            Then the values that were read from ROM were to be passed through the circuitry units we designed to
            actually perform the actions the passed in instructions were intended to do.<br>
            Then, to verify if the instruction was executed properly we would store the final results of each stage
            in 1 of the 16 registers in the register file we made for memory.

            A personal project that I have made the concept for is an audio application for mobile.<br>
            It's main use is the same idea as Apple Music, Spotify, Sound Cloud, etc.<br>
            To play music from you phone for ease of access. However my app isn't meant for streaming
            music. It is meant to play audio files that you have stored locally on your device to be saved
            into libraries/playlists that you have created in the app.<br>
            This is mainly so people can play their own music or any audio they wish to listen to on the go
            without the need for streaming.<br>
            I also intend to have some basic audio editing features like Audacity (change Speed, Pitch, Tempo,
            Volume, Normalize, etc.)
            to allow users to make those sutle changes they wish to make without having to use other Third-Party
            applications just for basic edits.
